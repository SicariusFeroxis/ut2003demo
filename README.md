# How to play online anno 2023?

To play multiplayer anno 2023 you need to edit your windows hosts file (located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts) like this making use of the FOSS project [OpenSpy.net (beta)](openspy.net).

```txt
157.245.212.59 master1.epicgames.com
157.245.212.59 master2.epicgames.com
157.245.212.59 ut2003master1.epicgames.com
157.245.212.59 ut2003master2.epicgames.com
157.245.212.59 master0.gamespy.com
```

The ip `157.245.212.59` is the current IP address of `utmaster.openspy.net`.
If it changes you'll need to edit your host file accordingly.
